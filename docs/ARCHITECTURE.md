# Architecture

## Goal

Support Windows and Android now, with iOS, web, automation, and other clients later, while maintaining one tested implementation of Quad Cortex behavior. The architecture follows ports and adapters: stable device concepts and application use cases sit in the center; USB, IPC, network, UI, MCP, voice, storage, and operating-system integrations sit at the edges.

The Windows native broker, Android direct adapter, and direct MCP mode are alternative QC owners. They must not open the hardware simultaneously.

## Modules and dependency rules

### Python parity packages

`services/device-gateway` and `pyquadcortex` are retained only as a source-level
differential oracle and protocol reference. They are not packaged in Windows or
Android and cannot be selected by either application. They are exercised only
by development tests invoked independently of the shipped clients.

### `services/device-broker` and `packages/rust/qc-device-runtime`

The Rust broker is the Windows composition root and exclusive OS-level device
owner. It exposes framed `gateway.v1` over stdio, owns Windows HID handles and
IPC, and delegates device-session policy, report normalization/assembly,
snapshot/preset-library behavior, and operation policy to `qc-device-runtime`.
Stateless wire encoding and decoding live in `qc-protocol`.

The Python device gateway is the parity oracle, not a deployed composition root.

### MCP and remote services

The legacy Python MCP package is retained as a local compatibility oracle. New public
connector deployments use three Rust services:

- `services/rust-mcp` owns the `rmcp` tool/resource surface and per-request
  principal/device route requirement.
- `services/qc-relay` owns OAuth resource metadata, bearer authorization,
  pairing, revocation, rate limits, active-device routing, and the outbound
  `qc-relay.v1` WebSocket protocol.
- `services/qc-remote` composes both Axum routers, validates external OAuth
  tokens through introspection, and is the HTTPS reverse-proxy deployment target.

Local gateway mode reaches the same Rust device broker contract used by the
Windows client. Remote mode reaches either a paired Windows broker or the paired
Android native host through an authenticated outbound relay connection; neither
deployed path loads Python or pyquadcortex.

`packages/rust/qc-relay-protocol` owns the shared relay wire frames and limits.
`packages/rust/qc-relay-client` owns the reusable outbound Rust client used by
Windows. The complete manifest-defined action allowlist and minimum access tier for
Windows, Android, and the server are generated from `qc-actions.v1.json`. A
contract test requires it to remain an exact gateway-method set, so a new
Windows RPC cannot silently be omitted from Android.

The public server is only an OAuth resource server. Identity remains with a
configured OAuth 2.1 authorization server supporting S256 PKCE. Exact issuer,
resource/audience, expiry, and scope are checked on every request. No provider
consumer token, browser cookie, HID frame, protobuf payload, or arbitrary RPC is
accepted by the remote boundary.

### `packages/python/qc-gateway-client`

Provides a Python implementation of the versioned gateway contract. It is used by gateway-mode MCP and future Python integrations, not by `qc-core`.

### `contracts`

Contains versioned, language-neutral schemas for commands, results, snapshots, events, errors, capabilities, confirmation requests, and protocol negotiation. JSON Schema is the initial interchange definition. Generated Python/TypeScript/Kotlin/Swift models are build artifacts and are never hand-edited.

Five protocol manifests currently prevent platform drift:

- `ProductionAutomation.proto` owns every numeric `CortexMessageType` wire ID. `qc-usb-profile.v1.json` owns USB identity, handshake/sync timing, named subscriptions, frame limits, keepalive policy, remote-gesture/File-stream pacing, and performance MIDI mappings; generation resolves its subscription names through that protobuf enum.
- `qc-domain.v1.json` owns Grid/scene/tempo limits, scene colors, route IDs/labels/groups, and IPC frame limits.
- `gateway-methods.v1.json` owns every gateway RPC, TypeScript client method,
  generated Rust allowlist, generated Android dispatch class, and the identical
  native method set exposed by Windows and Android. Windows sends the canonical
  `{ method, params }` envelope through one allowlisted Tauri command; Android
  sends the same envelope through one Capacitor command. Methods still supported
  by the source-only Python oracle are explicitly identified by the manifest.
- `qc-actions.v1.json` owns the cross-surface assistant/MCP action names, RPC mapping, descriptions, schemas, and read/live/persistent safety class.
- `qc-payloads.v1.schema.json` owns snapshots, native state events, Grid/editor structures, and action results generated for TypeScript, Rust, and Python.

`app-parity.v1.json` is the executable product-capability inventory. It records
which Windows/Android features must remain equivalent, whether their owner is a
shared package or a thin native adapter, and the evidence that each composition
root still exposes them. Platform-only delivery and desktop-shell features need
an explicit rationale. `npm run app-parity:check` validates the inventory and is
part of the software parity gate.

`npm run protocol:generate` materializes the required Rust, Java, Python, TypeScript, JSON Schema, and Tauri binding files. `npm run protocol:check` fails when a checked-in generated file drifts from its manifest.

Each request carries a protocol version, request ID, command kind, payload, and optional expected-state guard. Errors use stable codes plus human-readable detail. Capability negotiation lets old clients hide unsupported features safely.

### TypeScript packages

- `qc-core` owns shared Windows/Android behavior: the gateway-backed device transport adapter, realtime command coordinator, optimistic state and rollback, stale-echo reconciliation, surface commands, routing taxonomy and constraints, editor transitions, tempo, footswitch semantics, assistant action validation and device-command resolution. It imports no React, browser, Tauri, Capacitor, or native USB APIs.
- `qc-client` owns generated TypeScript types and the stable `gateway.v1` transport contract.
- `qc-ui` owns reusable web components for the QC screen and controls plus React bindings for the core parameter-editor, realtime device-command, assistant-action, and public-relay sessions. `useQcController` keeps native-frame commits synchronous with the current snapshot, serializes rapid adjacent-preset requests, and runs the same optimistic send/readback/rollback transaction for every platform, including assistant-initiated performance commands. `usePublicRelayWorkflow` owns pairing lifecycle, reconnect, status refresh, access-mode updates, and pending state while accepting either Windows polling or Android event subscription; the package imports no Tauri or Capacitor APIs.
- `qc-form-factors` owns declarative geometry and skins. Manifests refer to semantic controls such as `footswitch:A`, not backend methods.

Realtime native adapters timestamp observations at the device boundary and
batch all updates decoded from one device frame. `qc-protocol` owns the
stateless HID codec, bounded payload decompression, protobuf schemas, typed commands, state normalization, and
complete ModelRepo parameter/display semantics. The long-lived
`qc-device-runtime::transport::TransportRuntime` owns native report-layout
normalization, receive-frame assembly and recovery, handshake selection,
connection phases, keepalive reservation, reconnect cadence, read-error
tolerance, post-handshake initialization, and preset-catalog verification
policy. Its readiness projection is bidirectional: an authoritative rebuild
returns a live session to `Syncing` until a fresh seed restores `Ready`. It
also owns encoded-write pacing, mutation confirmation/readback
cadence, the event-driven verification state machine, preflight/readback/refresh
selection, post-write refreshes, composite read dependencies, response
type/request-id correlation, and monotonic request deadlines. Windows links it
directly into the native broker; Android reaches it
through JNI and passes raw endpoint bytes into it. `qc-core` owns pending-command
reconciliation, command transactions, batch reduction, and the provider-neutral
bounded chat/tool-loop controller, so both clients share wire interpretation,
ordering, editor metadata, routing rules, and stale-echo behavior while retaining only the
platform-specific USB handle, permission, endpoint, and lifecycle code. HID
reads, writes, performance MIDI, and ModelRepo parsing use independent lanes.
Both native hosts retain the USB handle for the full connected session and
expose the same manifest-defined gateway methods. Their remaining native code is limited to
OS permission/interface discovery, endpoint I/O, serialized scheduling,
lifecycle adaptation, and notifications. Shared Rust owns tempo-clock decoding,
backup chunk assembly and validation, command planning, HID-versus-MIDI lane
selection, and response projection.

Both event adapters pass their native frame through `consumeQcNativeStateFrame`,
which applies the shared sequence guard, preserves the device-boundary
observation timestamp, and derives the same tempo-pulse epoch before live state
reduction. Tauri and Capacitor therefore own only event subscription mechanics.

Cross-native transport policy lives in `contracts/qc-usb-profile.v1.json`; its
generated Java/Rust/Python constants take message IDs from
`ProductionAutomation.proto`. Runtime reconnect cadence, handshake attempts,
report-layout probing, frame recovery, keepalive scheduling, and read-error
tolerance live in `qc-device-runtime::transport::TransportRuntime`, used by
both native hosts. Native
adapters may differ in OS lifecycle and endpoint APIs, but they do not
independently choose session policy, handshake versions, subscriptions, frame
limits, keepalive timing, or performance MIDI mappings.
Android obtains its automatic-reconnect delay and due/attempt reservation from
the same runtime as the Windows worker; clearing decoded state does not reset
that transport decision. Both hosts also use the generated preset-sync and
command-confirmation bounds for protocol-facing waits.

The outbound public-relay clients likewise generate their protocol version,
device WebSocket path, request/result limits, replay window, readiness cadence,
and reconnect backoff from `contracts/qc-relay-profile.v1.json`. Windows uses
the shared Rust client while Android retains only the platform foreground
service and OkHttp lifecycle needed by the operating system.

The Windows app composes these packages with Tauri. A future React Native client may reuse `qc-client` and manifests without being forced to reuse DOM components. Native Kotlin/Swift clients can instead generate models from the same contracts.

### Client apps

Each directory under `apps/` is a thin composition root for navigation, lifecycle, platform permissions, credential storage, networking, notifications, audio, and packaging. Client apps do not contain QC command rules or USB protocol code.

Client apps also never import one another. Shared React controls, styling, editor state, and the verified command journal belong in `qc-ui`; shared behavior, chat sessions, route drafts, and preview fixtures belong in `qc-core`. Platform-only composition such as the Windows routing editor and chat dock lives in focused components rather than the application root. This prevents a desktop-only stylesheet or compatibility wrapper from becoming an accidental mobile dependency.

## Command flow

1. A client creates a typed command with an expected device/preset/scene revision.
2. The gateway validates protocol version, capabilities, authorization, and confirmation level.
3. `qc-core` validates domain invariants and serializes the mutation.
4. `DevicePort` executes through the selected adapter.
5. The owner waits for a device event or performs delayed readback.
6. It publishes the authoritative result and journal entry to every subscribed client.

An interrupted or uncertain mutation is never blindly replayed. The owner reads device state first and reports whether it landed.

Windows and Android persist a local assistant access mode that defaults to full
guarded control. The cumulative tiers are **Read-only** for inspection;
**Performance** for buttons, views, master volume, and tempo; **Modify** for
those operations plus Grid, preset, scene, routing, and save edits; and **Full
control** for all of those plus system-level operations. Both native outbound
relay adapters enforce the generated tier for every remote request, so changing
or bypassing web UI state cannot authorize a broader operation. Manual app
controls remain independent.

## Device ownership and deployment modes

| Scenario | QC owner | Client path |
|---|---|---|
| Windows desktop only | bundled native Rust broker | private stdio JSON-RPC |
| Windows through public MCP | Windows Rust broker | paired outbound `wss://` relay |
| Android through public MCP | Android native USB host | paired foreground `wss://` relay |
| Headless computer/Raspberry Pi | gateway service | authenticated network API |
| Standalone MCP, desktop closed | MCP direct mode | MCP to core/device adapter |
| MCP while desktop owns QC | Windows gateway | MCP gateway mode |

The UI always displays the active ownership mode and can diagnose a lock held by Cortex Control or another project process.

## Repository enforcement

CI will enforce these boundaries with import rules, contract compatibility tests, and separate builds for each publishable module. A change to a contract must include versioning/compatibility coverage. Real-hardware mutation tests use only a configured scratch preset and are excluded from ordinary CI.

## Decisions deliberately deferred

- Native Kotlin/Swift versus a cross-platform mobile UI framework.
- Exact LAN discovery and pairing mechanism.
- MCP direct mode as a default or optional install extra.
- Monorepo task runner and package publishing registry.
- Public project license and trademark-approved visual assets.

These choices do not alter the core dependency direction.
