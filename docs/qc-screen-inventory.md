# Quad Cortex UI reconstruction inventory

Baseline: CorOS 4.1.0 / Cortex Control 4.1.0
Inventory date: 2026-09-04

This is the canonical coverage ledger for the reconstruction project. The
40-image physical corpus is a measured working subset, not the complete list of
Quad Cortex screens. The inventory is derived from every UI-bearing section and
figure in the official 4.1.0 user manual. Hardware diagrams, cable diagrams,
logos, and purely explanatory illustrations are excluded.

The executable companion ledger at
`references/qc-ui-coverage/coros-4.1.0/coverage.json` maps every row below to
its shared renderer and exact physical, official-manual, or dual-host smoke
evidence. Run `npm run verify:coverage` to reject missing, duplicate, stale, or
unrouted entries.

The generated [canonical coverage matrix](qc-screen-coverage-matrix.md) joins
this inventory to the executable evidence ledger and the latest Windows and
Android similarity results. It is the comprehensive per-state report; rows
without authoritative evidence are explicitly shown without a visual score.

Status vocabulary:

- **Built**: a dedicated in-screen reconstruction exists.
- **Partial**: the family exists, but an important mode, control, or state is
  absent or approximate.
- **Shell**: the app exposes the operation in its own UI, but does not reproduce
  the CorOS screen.
- **Missing**: no reconstruction exists.
- **Capture**: a physical 800x480 reference exists in the local corpus.
- **Official**: a native 800x480 Quad Cortex frame from the official 4.1.0
  manual exists in the local, checksummed reference corpus. `Capture + Official`
  means both independent references exist.

Android refers to the buildable responsive React application in this checkout,
which embeds the same `@ndsp-qc/ui` surface as Windows. Its rows are verified
from that shared renderer and the Android build rather than inferred from a
placeholder or a separate prototype.

## Cortex Control-only companion screens

These belong in the Windows reconstruction but are not physical-device CorOS
screens. They are tracked separately so they do not distort physical-screen
coverage.

| CC-01 | Startup / connect device | Built | Built (USB status) |
| CC-02 | Multiple-device chooser | Missing | Not applicable |

| CC-04 | Main Directory workspace | Built | Missing |
| CC-05 | Desktop parameter editor | Built | Adapted in-screen editor |
| CC-06 | Utility bar | Built | Adapted controls |
| CC-07 | Master-volume mismatch | Missing | Missing |

## Totals and interpretation

- **104** canonical device screen/state rows are tracked (GL through OV).
- **16** Cortex Control-only companion rows are tracked separately.
- **119** physical framebuffer captures currently exist; they are the first
  regression pack, not the denominator for total product coverage.
- **37** official native-size manual frames are checksummed locally: 36 full-size
  Quad Cortex screens map to the shared renderer and one Quad Cortex mini frame
  is tracked separately rather than compared to the full-size device.
- **95** canonical states currently have full-frame physical or official-manual
  image evidence, and **99** have either full-frame or scoped official-detail
  evidence. All **104** have a verified exact-size capture path on both
  hosts: 84 through the general smoke pack and the remaining 20 through their
  physical or official-reference regression packs. These sets overlap and are
  checked by the executable coverage ledger.
- Parameter-model permutations are not each counted as separate screens. They
  are test fixtures within ED-01/ED-02 unless their layout is specialized (Cab,
  EQ, Looper X, splitter, or mixer).
- Visual fidelity percentages are only valid after an app frame and physical
  frame are captured at the same 800x480 content state. Audit estimates must be
  labeled as estimates, never mixed with measured similarity.

## Capture priority

The next physical-corpus expansion should close complete high-value families:

1. I/O overview plus the remaining output, Send/Return, and headphones panels.
2. The remaining Directory category, search-entry, sorting, filtering, and
   multiselect states not represented by an official full frame.
3. Splitter, mixer, remaining Virtual Device preset and assignment states.
4. Remaining Settings tabs, recovery screens, and Capture V1 workflow states.
5. Lifecycle overlays and warning/error variants.
