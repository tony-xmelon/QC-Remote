# Quad Cortex canonical screen coverage matrix

Generated from the CorOS 4.1.0 executable coverage ledger. This report distinguishes implemented render paths from authoritative visual evidence; a smoke-only row has no defensible visual-match percentage yet.

## Coverage summary

- Canonical device states: **103/103** routed through the shared Windows/Android surface.
- Full-frame authoritative evidence: **59/103** states.
- Official-detail-only evidence: **20/103** states.
- Smoke-only evidence gaps: **24/103** states.
- Exact-size dual-host capture paths: **103/103** states.

| Corpus | Windows structural | Windows color | Android structural | Android color |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Physical device | 91.55% | 97.39% | 91.54% | 97.39% |
| Official manual | 91.91% | 97.15% | 91.91% | 97.15% |

Scores are edge-F1 structural match with a two-pixel tolerance and `1 - MAE` color similarity. A canonical state that references multiple frames reports their mean. Detail evidence is scoped and therefore never promoted into a full-frame score.

## Authoritative evidence gaps

These states are implemented and captured on both hosts, but only against deterministic reconstruction fixtures. They require a physical framebuffer or an official visual before a visual-match percentage is meaningful.
