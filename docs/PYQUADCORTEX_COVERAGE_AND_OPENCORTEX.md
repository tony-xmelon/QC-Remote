This is a point-in-time boundary document. The QC protocol is private and
firmware-sensitive, so claims must be rechecked when CorOS or pyquadcortex is
updated.

## Decision

Keep pyquadcortex as a source-level differential oracle and future protocol
reference, not as a deployed implementation. The shared `qc-protocol` and
`qc-device-runtime` Rust crates are authoritative at runtime on Windows and
Android. Do not merge OpenCortex code into the normal Windows, Android, gateway,
or MCP runtime.

There is no immediate product benefit that justifies integrating OpenCortex.
Record its potentially useful work for later:

| OpenCortex area | Possible future value | Decision and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy VNC/root screen capture | An alternative to the native CorOS 4.1 USB screen messages now implemented in Rust | Deferred. The known OpenCortex route requires root/SSH and old on-device binaries; the normal product uses the non-root USB protocol. |
| Capture decryption and `Capture.proto` | Offline capture inspection, metadata, validation, and comparison | Deferred. Existing decryptor declares GPLv3, uses the device serial for user content, and has not been validated against current CorOS. Keep any future implementation isolated and review licensing first. |
| Direct stomp/rotary input and LED bridge | True press/release, encoder, and LED events | Deferred. Requires software installed on a rooted QC and relies on old internal Linux input formats. Never make it a consumer default. |
| Historical ModelRepo XML, presets and setlists | Regression fixtures and legacy-import testing | May be copied into a test-only fixture set after provenance/licensing review. Never use as the current device catalog or preset schema. |
| Root access, firmware tools, model renaming, old backup paths and CorOS build environment | Homebrew research | Out of scope for the normal product because of security, warranty, compatibility and bricking risk. Current live USB operations take precedence. |

## pyquadcortex coverage baseline

The upstream manual audit contains 105 feature rows:

- 65 fully supported and verified on hardware;
- 8 partially supported;
- 21 unsupported;
- 11 not applicable to a host controller.

Of 93 features that a host might plausibly drive, 65 are complete, 8 are partial,
and 20 remain untouched. This measures pyquadcortex itself, not how much of its
API QC Remote currently exposes through its contracts, gateway, MCP tools and
clients.

The covered core is already broad: live preset and scene state, grid topology,
block placement/removal/movement, block and lane parameters, bypass and scene
mode, splitter/mixer routing, stomp and expression assignments, preset MIDI Out,
tempo/metronome settings, modes and Gig View, I/O controls, Global EQ, master
volume, setlists/folders/favourites/recents, preset save/move/delete/copy,
catalog/model pinning, capture listing/loading, and IR listing/loading.

## Native Rust parity audit

Rust is the deployed implementation; pyquadcortex is the comparison oracle.
Parity is measured by user-visible capability rather than matching Python helper
methods one-for-one.

### Contracted command surface: 100%

The current product contract is fully aligned: every contracted device action is
available to the shared Windows and Android application layer, the Rust MCP
server, and the native Rust gateway. Both native hosts expose the same
manifest-defined gateway RPC set. The generated Python schema remains a
source-only compatibility oracle and can intentionally omit native-only
workflows. Generation and parity tests fail when an action or native RPC is
absent from a required layer.

The pinned upstream `QuadCortex` class has 111 unique public methods, and the
tracked pending PRs add eight more. The machine-readable audit in
`contracts/pyquadcortex-parity.v1.json` accounts for all 119 with native Rust
commands, projections, runtime services, or pure helpers. The upstream tuner HID
no-op is superseded with Neural DSP's documented
MIDI CC 45 control. The host-capture-dialog acknowledgement exists as an exact
low-level Rust protocol primitive, but is deliberately not a product action
because neither implementation includes the capture recorder/trainer workflow.
Run `npm run parity:pyquadcortex` to reject non-native, missing, duplicated,
unknown, or stale evidence; when `PYQUADCORTEX_CLIENT` is supplied, the audit
also verifies the pinned upstream source hash after normalizing text line
endings, so the same upstream revision verifies on Windows and Unix checkouts.
CI additionally runs `npm run parity:pyquadcortex:github`, which fails whenever
upstream main or a tracked PR's head, state, draft flag, or added public methods
drift from the reviewed snapshot.

This 100% figure describes native supersession, not promotion of unsafe,
partially researched, or internal helpers into product commands. Capability
families outside that public upstream surface still require exact wire fixtures,
sparse-write rules, readback semantics, and hardware validation before exposure.

| Capability family | Native Rust status |
|---|---|
| Session/framing, live preset state, model catalogue, blocks, bypass, parameters, routing, footswitch assignment, preset recall/save/copy, master volume, tempo, tuner/Gig View visibility, screen capture/tap, backup | Implemented |
| Physical I/O connection state | Implemented by decoding the already-requested `IOSettings` message; projected to the shared snapshot and clients |
| Full I/O settings and writes | Native Rust reads every sparse input, output, headphone, USB, MIDI, expression-pedal and pairing field. Input gain uses the measured -12..+60 dB scale; selector and uncalibrated level fields remain normalized. Sparse updates emit one field per hardware message because the QC drops some coalesced fields. Every write is persistent-confirmed and covered by eventual-consistency readback/restoration in physical conformance. |
| Scene copy/swap, labels and colours | Implemented in this audit with typed commands, shared validation, state-based label/colour verification, RPC and generated Windows/Android bindings |
| Parameter scene mode and expression assignment | Native sparse Rust reads and writes cover placed blocks plus splitter and mixer parameters, with correct container keying, validation, RPC and generated Windows/Android bindings |
| Input Gate and Lane Output parameters | Native Rust explicitly projects the per-row `input_control` model 28000 and `output_control` model 23000, and exposes guarded read, low-latency preview, verified value write, and scene-mode write paths without pretending these controls occupy Grid columns |
| Expression-controlled block bypass | Implemented in native Rust with typed preset projection and authoritative readback for EXP 1/2, STOP/SWITCH/HEEL-TOE behavior, inversion, 0-5000 ms delay and latch emulation |
| Splitter and mixer parameters | Native Rust reads and normalized writes use the correct bare combined-splitter and hash-keyed mixer containers; ordinary block dispatch cannot accidentally address these virtual columns |
| Splitter/mixer MUTE | Native Rust writes the device's asymmetric `splitBypass` field, reads the authoritative `mixBypass` result, applies exact stale-state guards, and exposes the same verified operation on Windows and Android. The control is global across scenes. |
| Tuner settings | Native Rust reads the selected input, mute preference, reference offset and absolute pitch. Guarded writes require both product-level risky-operation confirmation and a tuner-specific acknowledgement because each write invisibly engages the tuner; the restore-audio action clears the mute preference, and the physical tuner must still be opened and closed to release the invisible session. |
| General device settings | Native Rust now reads the complete sparse `GeneralSettings` reply and safely writes the hardware-verified brightness, hold timing, MIDI, dimming, access, lock, delay-compensation and scene-bypass fields. Whole-value Master Volume assignments and Cab/IR global-bypass rows are typed and atomic so partial submessage writes cannot clear unrelated flags. Power, reboot and Wi-Fi-reset commands are deliberately absent. |
| STOMP labels and momentary mode | Native sparse Rust writes and preset readback are implemented. The public planner automatically chooses the QC's single/multi-label map and refuses momentary changes unless exactly one block is assigned, matching the device's silent hardware restriction |
| Preset MIDI Out | Implemented in native Rust for all ten A-H/EXP sources and preset-load messages, including the hardware's MIDISettings wire route, 12-message replacement semantics, typed snapshots, readback verification, Windows/Android bindings, chat/MCP actions and physical conformance cases |
| Global EQ and mode-cycle settings | Native Rust read/write projections, validation, Windows/Android bindings, and eventual-consistency conformance cases are implemented. |
| Tempo and metronome settings | Native Rust decodes PRESET/GLOBAL mode plus all metronome fields and thirteen beat cells. Sparse writes preserve the QC's signature-before-beats ordering and are exposed identically through both hosts. |
| Favourites/recents, pinned models, captures and IR browsing/loading, setlist create/delete/duplicate and preset delete/move | Implemented in the shared Rust protocol/runtime and exposed identically through Windows, Android, chat, MCP, and the physical conformance harness. Setlist duplication deliberately composes verified recall-and-save stages because the native bulk-copy protocol remains unverified |
| Capture creation, imports, cloud/account operations, calibration, native bulk copy and firmware operations | Not parity targets: upstream marks these partial, unsupported, unexplored or unsafe |

No unsupported candidate message is promoted merely because its protobuf type
exists. Each remaining family requires an exact wire fixture, sparse-write rules,
readback semantics and a native contract test before it becomes public.

## Surface not fully covered by pyquadcortex

### High-value local-control gaps

| Surface | Current boundary | Practical route or next investigation |
|---|---|---|
| Looper transport | Status is read through the native protocol; play/record/overdub/undo and related controls use the shared documented MIDI CC mapping | Keep MIDI endpoint discovery in the platform adapter. Investigate the observed `Looper` button pushes only if HID parity becomes valuable. |
| Undo/redo | Native Rust commands and gateway methods are implemented with byte-level protocol tests; connected-device verification remains required for each supported CorOS release | Keep app-local history distinct from the QC's own undo stack. |
| Set Parameters as Defaults | `DefaultParameters` is decoded/subscribed but has never been written | Capture, replay and read back the device action. |
| Expression calibration | Start/finish state is observable through `IOSettings`; the host cannot start or drive calibration | Capture the complete device flow. Physical pedal movement will still be required. |
| Expression assignment to lane MUTE/SOLO | Readable, but the device silently refuses the host write; other expression targets work | No safe HID route is known. Do not pretend success. |
| Tap tempo over HID | No attributed `GlobalTempo` parameter performs a tap | Use documented MIDI CC 44 or the physical-control/native MIDI bridge. |
| Live tuner needle | Open/close and tuner settings work; the unit refuses the meter-enable write and never streams the needle | Deliberately unsupported upstream. A host-side audio tuner would be a separate implementation. |
| DSP headroom prediction | Placement refusal is detected after the attempt; `CPULoad` does not arrive | Surface `BlockRefused`. Do not predict capacity until a reliable signal is found. |
| Compiler-inhibited Global EQ/Input Gate | Read and decode are exposed by the native Rust gateway | Keep the state read-only until safe mutation semantics are known. |
| USB audio routing | On-device USB level/headphone source/dry-wet work; detailed DI-versus-processed channel mapping is unexplored | Investigate the remaining `IOSettings` fields; host driver/DAW setup belongs outside pyquadcortex. |
| Internal MIDI clock flag | Most MIDI settings are writable; `internal_midi_clock_enabled` is refused | Keep the refusal until a verified route exists. |
| Device name | Native Rust identity read and device-name write are implemented with correlated readback | Revalidate field limits and persistence on each supported CorOS release. |

### Library and file-management gaps

| Surface | Current boundary |
|---|---|
| On-device search | No search operation; `RecentSearches` is only a candidate. Client-side search over complete listings is available. |
| Native bulk copy | `BulkOperation` reports progress but is not driven. pyquadcortex emulates copies with recall-and-save, which is slower. |
| Capture management | Captures can be listed and loaded, but not renamed, deleted, moved or otherwise managed. |
| IR import | Existing IRs can be listed and loaded. Host-to-device import payload encoding remains unsolved and prior probing destabilized the USB connection. |
| Preset/plugin-preset import | Native host import is unsolved. Ordinary device preset save/list operations are supported. |
| Plugin preset browsing | `License` and `CloudProduct` are candidates; no complete plugin-preset API exists. |
| Preset cloud metadata | Description, author and cloud ID cannot be set through the verified grid/save path; the device supplies author information from its account. |

### Neural Capture and account/cloud gaps

| Surface | Current boundary |
|---|---|
| Neural Capture v1 creation | Initial host-dialog handshake is understood; recorder/trainer/refiner workflow is unexplored. |
| Neural Capture v2 creation | Message decodes, but the workflow is unexplored. |
| Capture calibration, A/B testing and save metadata | Candidate fields are known, but the end-to-end flow is not implemented. |
| Plugin licences/entitlements | `License` is decoded and subscribed but not interpreted. Catalog entries expose some plugin identifiers. |
| Cortex Cloud sign-in, products, upload and sharing | Candidate messages are decoded; no supported authenticated workflow exists. |
| Cloud backups | Candidate messages exist but have not been driven. |
| Local backups | The native Rust broker implements chunked current-firmware device backup; this is project functionality, not an upstream pyquadcortex claim. |

### Diagnostics and intentionally excluded operations

- Detailed DSP, footswitch and USB diagnostics are not covered. `ModuleStats` is
  decoded, while deeper diagnostic families have no public high-level behavior.
- CorOS firmware update is intentionally not driven. A failed experiment can
  brick the unit and is outside this project's control scope.
- Power off, reboot, Be Right Back, screen lock, recovery-mode entry, cabling,
  encoders and footswitch mechanics remain physical or intentionally excluded
  operations. CorOS 4.1 screen capture and coordinate taps are implemented over
  the native USB RemoteControl messages; they do not require root access.
- Wi-Fi/network control has no usable non-root route. USB-HID remains the local
  transport; MIDI is appropriate for documented performance controls.
- The upstream baseline did not expose native screen pixels. This project now
  implements the CorOS 4.1 RemoteControl screenshot and tap messages directly in
  Rust, separately from the legacy pyquadcortex high-level API.

## Schema visibility is not functional support

The vendored protobuf schema names many more messages and fields than the
high-level API can safely drive. Decoding a message, subscribing to it, or seeing
a candidate field does not mean its operation, units, sequencing, side effects or
failure behavior are understood. QC Remote must expose only verified behavior
through typed contracts and keep unsupported operations explicit.

The live ModelRepo parser resolves clone inheritance and replacements and
projects display ordering, visibility, footswitch-toggle metadata, linked scene
mode, tooltips, and midpoint labels. Unknown future attributes remain evidence
for investigation rather than permission to infer behavior.

## Revisit triggers

Revisit this document when any of the following happens:

1. pyquadcortex adds or changes a capability in its manual-coverage audit;
2. a CorOS release changes the protocol or introduces an official remote API;
3. Neural DSP provides a non-root screen-mirroring or remote-control route;
4. QC Remote needs capture creation, file import, library management, cloud, or
   diagnostics as an immediate product feature;
5. an OpenCortex component is considered for distribution, which requires a
   fresh compatibility, security and licence review.
